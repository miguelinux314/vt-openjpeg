VT-OPENJPEG Package
================================
vt-openjpeg is an open-source implementation of visually-optimised JPEG 2000 encoding, which is derived from OpenJpeg.
It also contains a matlab toolbox that measures visual threshold (VT) of each wavelet coefficients subbands.
The VT-based JPEG 2000 encoder is described in Reference[1,4], and the VT measurement procedures are described in Reference[1,2,3].

Installation
---------------------------------
There are two ways of downloading the latest version of the vt-openjpeg project
* Download the zip file at https://github.com/spacl-ua/vt-openjpeg/archive/master.zip 
* Git clone with a git client:
	'git clone  https://github.com/spacl-ua/vt-openjpeg.git'
The easiest way of building the project is to use the cmake & make system provided by the original Openjpeg project, i.e. at the current folder type
	'cmake .'
	'make' 
Optionally, you can make a system-wide installation with
	`sudo make install` 
The compressor and decompressor are created at
 `bin/opj_compress` (compressor)
 `bin/opj_decompress` (decompressor)
More build and installation options (e.g. Using third-party library for TIFF/PNG format) can be achieved by following the instruction provided in INSTALL

Quick Manual
---------------------------------
The easiest way of invoking the encoder is by providing all the visual thresholds (VT) through a tab-delimited text file.
For example, given the sample VT file at 'data/monitorA_VT1.txt', simply use the following command:
	'opj_compress -i test.bmp -o test.jp2 -I -vt data/monitorA_VT1.txt'
For more advanced usage please refer to the wiki page: https://github.com/spacl-ua/vt-openjpeg/wiki/Usage


Details on folders hierarchy:
---------------------------------
* src(symobol "+" denotes the particular folder has been modified from the original OpenJpeg implementation to enable VT-optimized encoding)
  * lib
    * openjp2(+): contains the sources of the openjp2 library (Part 1 & 2), which contains modification for VT-optimized encoder.
    * openjpwl: contains the additional sources if you want to build a JPWL-flavoured library.
    * openjpip: complete client-server architecture for remote browsing of jpeg 2000 images.
    * openjp3d: JP3D implementation
    * openmj2: MJ2 implementation
  * bin: contains all applications that use the openjpeg library
    * common: common files to all applications
    * jp2(+): a basic codec, which is able to encode/decode  VT-optimized codestream besides the original OpenJPEG codec's functionality
    * mj2: motion jpeg 2000 executables
    * jpip: OpenJPIP applications (server and dec server)
      * java: a Java client viewer for JPIP
    * jp3d: JP3D applications
      * tcltk: a test tool for JP3D
    * wx
      * OPJViewer: gui for displaying j2k files (based on wxWidget)
* matlab(+): contains the matlab toolbox for VT measurement
* vt_tests(+): contains shell script example that illustrates interface of the encoder. 
* data(+): contains example VT measurement data. 
* wrapping
  * java: java jni to use openjpeg in a java program
* thirdparty: thirdparty libraries used by some applications. These libraries will be built only if there are not found on the system. Note that libopenjpeg itself does not have any dependency.
* doc: doxygen documentation setup file and man pages
* tests: configuration files and utilities for the openjpeg test suite. All test images are located in 'http://openjpeg.googlecode.com/svn/data' folder.
* cmake: cmake related files
